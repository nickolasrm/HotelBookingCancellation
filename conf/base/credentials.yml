# This is the credentials file sent to production without explicit credentials.
# Use this for as a reference for environment variables
# for example:
# Let's say you have to log in using a token, and this token is stored
# into your compute instance environment variables.
# In the local/credentials.yml file you would have:
# credential:
#   token: aabbbcccdddd42
#
# In the base/credentials.yml file you would have:
# credential:
#   token: ${'TOKEN'}
